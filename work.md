# How do you strategically plan to implement without implementing partners?” An Exploration of the Relationship Between Funding Procedures and Developmental Project Outcomes (2023)

<span style="color:#408C59">Abstract</span>
Funding is the mechanism by which an overseas organization or government attaches itself to a locally based NGO. This research examines the relationship between the funding procedures and the implementation outcomes of development projects, as understood by the locally based organization. This study considers various non-governmental organizations and their experience with funding sources. Funders vary from corporate funders, local and foreign governments, international organizations, and private donors. To explore the relationship, we have adopted a qualitative approach and draw on in-depth interviews with representatives from several South African NGOs. The aim of the study is to understand the NGOs’ perspective on funding procedures and how they believe they influence their ability to meet their programmatic goals. Shedding light on the experiences and perspectives of implementing NGOs will help us understand the ways in which values and norms underlying funding practice shape the developmental space. This study highlights the need for NGOs and funders to construct healthy and open relationships to maximize the positive impact of developmental aid funding.

This model is based on the Car Price Determinants project, which uses an OLS regression to make predictions. Instead of using OLS, however, this implementation uses a Random Forest Model with cross-validation to predict car prices. The prices this model predicts are qualitatively closer to what I would expect. Due to its ability to create predictions using 100% of the data as testing and validation through cross-validation, this modeling technique has high potential. INTERACTIVE WEBPAGE COMING SOON

<span style="color:#408C59">Abstract: </span>
This project is based on an OLS regression built for Econometrics (ECON125) at Pitzer College. This paper seeks to assess what factors are significant in determining the price of a sports car, as well as document the specification fitting process for an OLS regression. Does top speed matter more than 0-60? Are there preferences for different aspiration types? The data covers 62 sports cars and all relevant explanatory variables for each.
