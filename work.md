# Car Price Determinants Econometrics Project (2021)
[PDF HERE]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ols_car.pdf)



<span style="color:#408C59">Abstract: </span>
This project is based on an OLS regression built for Econometrics (ECON125) at Pitzer College. This paper seeks to assess what factors are significant in determining the price of a sports car, as well as document the specification fitting process for an OLS regression. Does top speed matter more than 0-60? Are there preferences for different aspiration types? The data covers 62 sports cars and all relevant explanatory variables for each.

# Car Price Determinants Random Forest Implementation (2023)
INTERACTIVE WEBPAGE HERE

CODE HERE

<span style="color:#408C59">Description: </span>
This model is based on the Car Price Determinants project, which uses an OLS regression to make predictions. Instead of using OLS, however, this implementation uses a Random Forest Model with cross-validation to predict car prices. The prices this model predicts are qualitatively closer to what I would expect. Due to its ability to create predictions using 100% of the data as testing and validation through cross-validation, this modeling technique has high potential. 

# Developmental Aid Research Project
[RESEARCH PROPOSAL HERE]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Research Proposal for Kolisi Foundation ISP.pdf)

RESEARCH PAPER HERE

<span style="color:#408C59">Abstract: </span>
The research project, "Investigating Developmental Aid Effectiveness: A Study with Kolisi Foundation," aims to analyze the efficacy of developmental aid efforts and identify best practices to drive positive impact while mitigating unintended consequences. In partnership with the Kolisi Foundation, the project will address key framing questions related to aid purpose, goals, evaluation, utilization, misappropriation prevention, need determination, dependency relationships, political influence, stakeholders, and differences in administering aid. Through hands-on experience and high-level strategy development, the project aims to generate insights, contribute to academic discourse, and potentially serve as the foundation for the author's senior thesis.

# Tabalau Analytics Dashboard (Manifest)

This doesn't actually exist yet, but I want to create a sample dashboard about covid or something else meaningful to showcase the skills that I haven't actually learned yet
