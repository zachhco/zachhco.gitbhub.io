# Car Price Determinants Econometrics Project (2021)
[PDF HERE]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ols_car.pdf)



<span style="color:#408C59">Abstract: </span>
This is a project based on a OLS regression built for Economectrics (ECON125) at Pitzer College. This research seeks to assess what factors are significant in determining the price of a sports car; Does top speed matter more than 0-60? Are there preferences for different aspiration types? The data covers 62 different sports cars and all relevant explanatory variables for each.

# Car Price Determinants Random Forest Implementation (2023)
INTERACTIVE WEBPAGE HERE

CODE HERE

<span style="color:#408C59">Description: </span>
This is based off of the Car Price Deterninants project using an OLS regression to make predictions. Instead of using OLS, however, this implementation ususes a Random Forest Model with cross validatoin to predict car prices. Due to its ability to create predictions using 100% of the data as testing and calidation through cross validatoin, this modeling tenchinque has high potential. The prices this model predicts are qualitativley closer to what I would expect. 

# Developmental Aid Research Project
[RESEARCH PROPOSAL HERE]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Research Proposal for Kolisi Foundation ISP.pdf)

RESEARCH PAPER HERE

<span style="color:#408C59">Abstract: </span>
The research project, "Investigating Developmental Aid Effectiveness: A Study with Kolisi Foundation", led by Zach Cohen, aims to analyze the efficacy of developmental aid efforts and identify best practices to drive positive impact while mitigating unintended consequences. In partnership with the Kolisi Foundation, the project will address key framing questions related to aid purpose, goals, evaluation, utilization, misappropriation prevention, need determination, dependency relationships, political influence, stakeholders, and differences in administering aid. Through hands-on experience and high-level strategy development, the project aims to generate insights, contribute to academic discourse, and potentially serve as the foundation for the author's senior thesis.
